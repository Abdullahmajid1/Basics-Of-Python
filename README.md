# Problem 1: Mode Calculation

## Overview

This repository contains code to calculate the mode of a list of numbers. Mode is defined as the value that appears most often in a set of data values.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the provided code in your preferred Python environment.
3. Follow the step-by-step instructions provided in the code comments to calculate the mode of the given list of numbers.

## Learning

### Tuples
- Tuples are immutable sequences, meaning their elements cannot be changed once created.
- They are often used to represent fixed collections of items.

### Sets
- Sets are unordered collections of unique elements.
- They are useful for tasks such as removing duplicates from a list.

### Dictionaries
- Dictionaries are key-value pairs where each key maps to a value.
- They are mutable and can be modified by adding, removing, or updating key-value pairs.

## Example

Suppose you have a list of average daily temperatures over 10 days:
```python
temperatures = [34, 40, 29, 33, 42, 40, 39, 34, 34, 33]
```
Running the provided script will calculate and print the mode temperature from this list.

# Problem 2: Modifying Tuples

## Overview

This task involves modifying a list of tuples by replacing the last element of the last tuple.

## Learning

### Tuples
- Tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation.
- However, you can create a new tuple with modified elements.

## Example

Given the input list of tuples:
```python
list_of_tuples = [(10,20,30), (30,40,50), (50,60,70)]
```
The script will replace the last element of the last tuple with 100 and print the updated list of tuples.

# Problem 3: Updating Sets

## Overview

This task involves updating a set of stop words by adding custom stop words.

## Learning

### Sets
- Sets are collections of unique elements.
- They are useful for tasks such as removing duplicates or checking membership.

## Example

The script adds custom stop words to the existing set of stop words and prints the updated set.

# Problem 4: Dictionary Operations

## Overview

This task involves checking for the presence of a key in a dictionary and modifying the dictionary accordingly.

## Learning

### Dictionaries
- Dictionaries are key-value pairs where each key maps to a value.
- They support various operations like adding, removing, and updating key-value pairs.

## Example

The script checks if a key 'Employee_ID' is present in the dictionary. If not present, it adds the key with the corresponding value 4503233.
