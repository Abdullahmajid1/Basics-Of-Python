# Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries
## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file (`Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries.ipynb`) covering various operations and tasks related to tuples, sets, and dictionaries in Python.
## Learning
The notebook covers the following topics:

- Understanding tuples and their immutability.
- Working with sets and their unique properties.
- Exploring dictionaries and their key-value pairs.
- Performing various operations and tasks involving tuples, sets, and dictionaries.

### Tuples
- Tuples are immutable sequences, meaning their elements cannot be changed once created.
- They are often used to represent fixed collections of items.
- However, you can create a new tuple with modified elements.

### Sets
- Sets are unordered collections of unique elements.
- They are useful for tasks such as removing duplicates from a list.

### Dictionaries
- Dictionaries are key-value pairs where each key maps to a value.
- They are mutable and can be modified by adding, removing, or updating key-value pairs.
